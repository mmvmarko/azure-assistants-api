    "\n",
    "- \"Extraordinary leave.pdf\"\n",

    "There is also a function that allows an employee to request a raise.\n",

    "Currently though (Feb 2024), the Azure OpenAI Assistants API does not allow you to configure the `retrieval` tool. You can only enable the `code_interpreter` tool. The `code_interpreter` tool might be able to open your documents and read them, but it's not as powerful as the retrieval tool. It basically has to use Python code to read the file and then answer questions about it.\n",
